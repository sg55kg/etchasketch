# etchasketch
The Odin Project etchasketch assignment.

Updated(8/11):
A day or two after my last update I got the actual grid creation and drawing functions finished. The last thing I am stuck on is making the color picker work, and then I plan on doing a little bit of final styling to make the page look a little nicer.

Updated(8/2/21):
Finally googled and found a way to make a clearGrid function that can be called when a button is clicked before creating the new grid. I was stuck on this for the last day because without this function a new grid was just tacked on to the bottom of the old one - making the page huge if you spammed a button several times. I tried to add in some if statements to the createGrid function yesterday but they did not work.

To do (8/2/21):
Add some more buttons to the control panel section to allow for color customizion and a reset button, and add the JS functions for those buttons. 

Not sure how I'll reset/clear the grid and make sure it stays the same size (16/16 or 32/32 etc). 

Also just need more general CSS stuff to make the page look nicer.
